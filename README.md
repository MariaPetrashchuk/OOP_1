# 🌱 Nature Markdown Reference

This is intended as a **quick reference and poetic guide** about the beauty of **nature** — forests, mountains, rivers, and life itself.  
See [John Gruber’s Markdown Spec](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for more syntax details,  
or just enjoy this green harmony of words and code.

> _Every line of Markdown, like every leaf on a tree, connects to something greater._

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are part of Markdown —  
and nature, too, can be described in **Python** 🐍.

Inline `code` shows small examples: `print("The forest breathes")`.

Blocks of code are fenced with triple backticks:

```python
# Simple Python code about nature

elements = ["earth", "water", "fire", "air"]

for e in elements:
    print(f"The element {e.upper()} keeps the world alive.")

print("And balance is the key to all life.")
